          Former trucker turned developer. Learn to code right? I 
          have finished the 12-week Full-Stack Web Developer
          Bootcamp at the University of Arizona where our
          instructors taught us the latest industry-driven
          full-stack MERN curriculum.

          Since 2016 I have driven an 18 wheeler across the United
          States delivering freight and customer service. That all
          changed in early 2022 once I began my journey into a new
          career as a developer.

          Instead of driving on the open road in my captain's
          chair I now use a different kind of chair, Secret Labs
          to be exact. I spend a lot of time learning about this
          new career path and developing the skills needed to
          excel wherever my path takes me. When I am not in my new
          captainâ€™s chair I spend my time reading, playing the
          ocasional video games, going to the gym, and yes I still
          go on the occasional long drives!
